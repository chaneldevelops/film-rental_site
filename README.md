## My Process

1. Project Planning and Requirements Gathering: I started some ideas for rental equipment sites and film was the first thing to come to mind because of my background in it. I did research on other film rental equipment companies to get a feel for the design, functionality and features. 

2. Design & Wireframe: 
Once I got a figured out the features I wanted, I created a wireframe to help me visualize the layout and user experience of the website. You can check out the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Euz9dcXlIdnZbkTnagJxVl/Scene-Setters-Wireframe?node-id=0%3A1&t=BSqqEw1Ed4LrYtMM-1) file. 

3. Gathered Assets:
After completing the wireframe I began search for images that fit well within the theme for the site and designed the logo in Canva. 

4. Front-End Development:
- I began laying out the skeleton of the site first with HTML, using the wireframe as my guide along the way. This mainly consisted of a header, sections, and a footer.
- After building the skeleton I added in the images and logos
- Styled each section based on their functionality and customer needs, creating grid layouts for the equipment and packages section.
- Lastly I styled the footer

5. Testing and Debugging: 
Throughout the development process, I constantly tested the website using Chrome's dev tools and on different devices to ensure that it was responsive and functioning correctly. 

6. Deployment:
Once the website was complete, I deployed it to [Netlify](https://film-rental-website.netlify.app/#contact).

Maintenance and Updates: After deploying the website, I continued to monitor it for any issues or bugs that may have arisen. I also made updates and improvements based on feedback from users and any new features that I wanted to add.


## Under Development:
- Optimizing the hambuger menu to adapt on smaller devices (more of a styling addition)
- An arrow button that navigates back to the top of the screen
- Changing the packages layout to stack on top of each other in mobile view
